# PowerShell Style Guide

A comprehensive style guide for writing consistent, maintainable, and professional PowerShell code. Designed for use by both human developers and AI agents (LLMs).

## 📖 About

This repository contains a detailed PowerShell style guide that establishes coding standards and best practices. Whether you're a developer writing PowerShell scripts or an AI agent generating code, this guide provides clear conventions to ensure consistency and quality.

## 📚 Documentation

The complete style guide is available in [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

### Generated Versions

For convenience, this repository automatically generates three additional versions of the style guide:

- **[copilot-instructions.md](copilot-instructions.md)** - For GitHub Copilot custom instructions in repositories that contain exclusively PowerShell code. Copy this file to your repository's `.github` folder as `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to enable Copilot to follow these conventions when generating code across your entire PowerShell project.

- **[powershell.instructions.md](powershell.instructions.md)** - For GitHub Copilot file-specific instructions in repositories with multiple programming languages. This version includes YAML frontmatter that targets only `*.ps1` files. Copy this file to your repository as `.github/instructions/powershell.instructions.md` to enable Copilot to follow these PowerShell conventions specifically for `.ps1` files, allowing you to have different instructions for other file types.
  
- **[STYLE_GUIDE_CHAT.md](STYLE_GUIDE_CHAT.md)** - Formatted for copy-pasting into interactive chat sessions with LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). The content is wrapped in a markdown code fence for easy sharing.

These files are automatically updated whenever [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) changes.
